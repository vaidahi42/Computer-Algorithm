Q1.

No, we can't decide the sequence of function execution. Because in call graph, the functions are sorted according to the time spent while execution. 

Q2.

Regarding the complexity of space and time
Here, O(nlogn) has the best programme time complexity and O(n^2)has the worst programme time complexity.
The average time complexity of a programme is O(n*log(n)).
The space complexity of a programme is O(n*log(n)).
Here, increasing the value of n lengthens the amount of time required to execute the application.
As a result, the program's run time is exactly proportional to n.
For smaller values of n, the programme runs in a shorter amount of time. (For instance, if n is 10 the execution time is almost 0).

The length of time required to run the software lengthens for bigger
Time complexity of quicksort :-
 Best case :- O(nlogn)-- In best case the pivot would be median element.
 Average case :- O(nlogn)--It is similar to the best case and the elements are unsorted.
 Worst case :- O(n^2)--In the pivot could be end element.

Time complexity :- 
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
  T(n/2) = 2T(n/4) + n/2
  T(n/4) = 2T(n/8) + n/4
  .          .        .
  .          .        .
  .          .        .
   T(1) = 1
So, levels will be n/(2^k) = 1
                   n= 2^k
                   k = logn

T(n) = n+ n+n+....log n terms 
So, O(nlogn) will be the best case time complexity.
